# PAYMONGO QR Ph Integration (Unofficial / Personal Use)

**Repository:** `kekeke3/PAYMONGO_QR_PH`  
**Language:** PHP  

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates an **integration of QR Ph payments using PayMongo** for personal or testing purposes. It allows you to **deduct payments from their GCash or QR Ph-enabled accounts for testing purposes, while the actual payment is processed and received in PayMongo** without requiring a formal business permit.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** This setup is intended for **personal use or learning purposes only**. Using it for commercial activities without a proper business permit may violate Philippine regulations.

## Features

- Generate **QR Ph payment links** for personal or testing transactions  
- Handle **success and failure callbacks** via webhook  
- Track payment status in **real-time** using PayMongo API  
- Simple **PHP-based implementation** for easy setup and modification

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kekeke3/PAYMONGO_QR_PH.git
Install a local PHP server (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP, or native PHP)

Set up your PayMongo API keys in the PHP files

Open index.php to initiate a payment request

Configure your webhook URL in your PayMongo dashboard to point to webhook.php

How It Works
User scans the QR Ph code generated by index.php or qr_test_full.php

User completes the payment using GCash or any QR Ph-enabled bank

PayMongo sends a webhook notification to webhook.php

Payment success or failure is logged and displayed in success.php or failed.php

Limitations
Not for official commercial use; intended for personal or educational purposes

Payments are processed through your personal GCash/linked accounts

No business permit integration—ensure you comply with local laws before commercial use
